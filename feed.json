				"content_html": "<p>As I was prepare for a work trip last week, I found myself cleaning out my travel bag and stumbled upon a pleasant surprise—notes from my travel notebook. One note, in particular, caught my attention: a reflection from my trip to Japan earlier this year.</p>\n<p>During that visit, I had the privilege of exploring Sojiji Temple, one of Japan’s two main Zen Buddhist temples. While there, I witnessed a fascinating ceremony involving a woman doing calligraphy on a large sign. Intrigued but not fully understanding the significance of the event, I stood quietly, observing and listening.</p>\n<p>After the ceremony, the event’s MC approached me, likely noticing I was the only foreigner in attendance. She kindly asked if I understood what was happening and then took the time to explain everything in English. To my surprise, she handed me a printed English translation of her script.</p>\n<p>One part of it particularly stood out:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Harmony is to be valued, and an avoidance of wanton opposition to be honored. All men are influenced by partisanship, and there are few who are intelligent. Hence there are some who disobey their lords and fathers, or who maintain feuds with the neighboring villages. But when those above are harmonious and those below are friendly, and there is concord in the discussion of business, right views of things spontaneously gain acceptance. Then what is there which cannot be accomplished?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This passage, part of the first article of Prince Shotoku’s 17-Article Constitution, underscores the importance of harmony. The ceremony I witnessed was a commemoration of Prince Shotoku and his dedication to this principle—a value deeply influenced by Buddhism and enshrined in his vision for society.</p>\n<p>What struck me then—and resonates even more now—is how deeply the idea of harmony is woven into Japanese culture. Having lived in Japan for three years, I experienced firsthand the kindness, politeness, and respect that permeate daily life. Even when people disagree or dislike one another, they prioritize civility and cooperation. Society functions smoothly because people take their roles seriously, no matter how big or small, understanding that everyone’s efforts are interconnected.</p>\n<p>Of course, this cultural emphasis on harmony isn’t without challenges. The pressure to maintain outward politeness can sometimes suppress negative emotions, leading to mental health issues. Still, the overall atmosphere of mutual respect creates a unique and admirable social fabric—one that stands in stark contrast to many places I’ve been.</p>\n<p>It’s hard not to reflect on how much the United States could benefit from embracing a similar sense of harmony. We often lose sight of the fact that we function best as a collective, working together with mutual respect. Disagreements—whether political, religious, or otherwise—don’t need to devolve into constant conflict.</p>\n<p>To be clear, I’m not advocating for silence in the face of hate or injustice. Those must always be confronted. But as a society, we should strive to make respect and civility our default. Harmony doesn’t mean suppressing our individuality or ignoring our differences. Instead, it’s about finding ways to coexist, recognizing our shared humanity, and working together toward a greater good.</p>\n<p>If there’s one lesson I took away from that day at Sojiji Temple, it’s that harmony is not just a lofty ideal—it’s a practical path to a better, more connected world.</p>\n",
