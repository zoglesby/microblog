			 <p>As the old saying goes, “The only constant in life is change.” My life has been ruled by it, moving around as a kid, life in the military, and the same old stuff we all deal with as we age and grow.</p>
<p>For the last 15 years, my wife has been the only constant in my life. We met in Delaware while I was stationed there. We fell in love, got married, and I scooped her away from the only home she had ever known to go live in Spain with me.</p>
<p>We were young, very young. I now know I was dealing with the early stages of PTSD; having met her just weeks after coming home from a rough deployment, she gave me an escape from my pain. The thing about escapes is that they only work for so long, and eventually, I had to deal with my issues. It was not easy, and sometimes she boor the brunt of that pain. Anyone who knows me can tell you I don’t express my emotions well; she, on the other hand, needed all of hers on her sleeve. Needless to say, this difference resulted in a lot of tension, frustration, and confusion. We worked through it, but not absolutely. We had our first child in Spain, I got out of the military and had two more kids in Maryland, but tensions always remained.</p>
<p>Tension eventually rubs raw, like a dog licking a wound; the longer it lasts, the worse it gets. We both tried to change and adapt for the sake of the other, but changing who you are is difficult, if not impossible, and it never worked.</p>
<p>So here I am 15 years later, looking change in the eyes again. We are separating, and my home will not be hers for the first time since 2008. It’s hard to explain; we don’t hate each other or even really fight, but we are distant, and I can sense some resentment in her that I can’t bear￼. I am thankful that we get along and can raise our kids together, even if we are apart. It will be an adjustment for all of us, but I pray they will understand and feel our love for them.</p>
<p>I have lived with my wife for longer than anyone else (I lived with my mom until I was 11 and my dad until I was 18). If I was not as open as she wanted, she still knew me better than anyone else. It’s going to be strange to live alone again (part-time), it’s going to be hard not to see my kids every day, and it will be difficult not to be upset. Still, in the end, I will never feel regret. I will always love her, be glad for our time together, and forever cherish our children.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So when we witness some of the atrocities in the world that we have of late, it seems to me that what we are witnessing, in part, is what happens when an individual’s fear, hopelessness, powerlessness, and so forth, get recognition within a larger group. The individual’s reactions to those experiences are generalized and legitimized, at least within the group, and any hope of self-inquiry is lost.</p>

			 <p>I have been using Linux since 2001, most of the time using Red Hat Linux and Fedora. With a short spell of Arch around 2005-2006. Recently I learned about Guix and played with it for a bit, I thought it was cool, but it had a few issues so I moved on to Nix.
Both Guix and Nix are very different from traditional Linux distributions. They are both based around expression languages that enable the OS to be configured as code. For example, if I want to install and configure <a href="https://xmonad.org">Xmonad</a> I could use the following or at it to my configuration. (This is code for another tool, <a href="https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.html">home-manager</a>, but the idea is the same)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-nix" data-lang="nix">{

 };
 };
}
</code></pre></div><p>This type of configuration allows for a workflow similar to Ansible, Puppet, or Chef. The difference is that the package manager and the operating system are aware of the state. Role backs, for instance, are supported, even at the boot menu level. If you change your configuration and break the start-up process, you can simply boot into the previous configuration and fix it. This feature is built-in functionality that the OS is aware of, not something bolted on like many of the ZFS/package manager solutions that are popular now.
Nix is also not dependent on the traditional file system structure for binaries that most Linux distributions use. While you typically find Python at <code>/usr/bin/python</code> or something similar, Nix uses a hash such as <code>/nix/store/hb1lzaisgx2m9n29hqhh6yp6hasplq1v-python3-3.9.10/bin/python</code>. This hashed path enables several cool features, but the first is that you can use more than one version of Python or any other tool.
Nix-shell also allows you to have dependencies that are not in your <code>$PATH</code> for specific projects or folders. So you can <code>cd</code> into a directory where all of your dev tools will show up, but they will not be there while you are doing random things on your computer. It can also be helpful if you just need to run a program once but don&rsquo;t want to keep it installed as it can be cleaned up automatically later without you having to do anything.</p>
