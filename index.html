			 <p>I recently setup fprintd on my laptop so that I could use the fingerprint reader for login and unlocking 1Password. It worked well until I plugged my laptop into the dock and closed the lid. It was unfortunately still prompting me for a fingerprint, even when I did not have access to the reader.</p>
<p>After a search I found an <a href="https://jim-think.blogspot.com/2020/10/disable-fingerprint-scanner-when-laptop.html">article</a> about how someone disabled the usb device on lid close so that it would stop this from happening. I only needed to find the correct device to disable. It was not listed in lsusb as a fingerprint reader, but the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Lenovo_ThinkPad_X1_Carbon_(Gen_9)">Archwiki</a> had the information I needed. After that I just needed to find where it was in the device tree.</p>
<pre><code>$ grep 06cb /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idVendor
/sys/bus/usb/devices/3-3/idVendor:06cb
</code></pre>
<p>After adding the the following NixOS config everything worked just how it should.</p>
<pre><code>services.acpid = {
    enable = true;
   lidEventCommands = ''
    grep -q close /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID/state
if [ $? = 0 ]; then
    echo 0 &gt; /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-3/authorized
fi

grep -q open /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID/state
if [ $? = 0 ]; then
    echo 1 &gt; /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-3/authorized

exit 0

<p>So when we witness some of the atrocities in the world that we have of late, it seems to me that what we are witnessing, in part, is what happens when an individual’s fear, hopelessness, powerlessness, and so forth, get recognition within a larger group. The individual’s reactions to those experiences are generalized and legitimized, at least within the group, and any hope of self-inquiry is lost.</p>

			 <p>Last week I posted about now I <a href="/2022/04/04/nix.html">moved to Nix</a> and the ways that it is different from the typical Linux distribution. One of the things that changed for my installations was the way that I manage Emacs packages.</p>
<p><a href="https://elpa.gnu.org/">ELPA</a> and <a href="https://melpa.org/">MELPA</a> packages as available as part of the distribution. Thanks to that effort, I can install Emacs and ensure that I have all of the additional tools that I want installed at the same time.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-nix" data-lang="nix">{

</code></pre></div><p>Installing additional packages this way means that I do not need to rely on <code>use-package</code> to download them when Emacs starts up. I can however still take advantage of <code>use-package</code> on in my configuration that way when I use another machine, like my work computer, everything will still work. Since the package is installed, and loaded into Emacs <code>ensure: t</code> will do nothing on Nix.</p>

			 <p>I have been using Linux since 2001, most of the time using Red Hat Linux and Fedora. With a short spell of Arch around 2005-2006. Recently I learned about Guix and played with it for a bit, I thought it was cool, but it had a few issues so I moved on to Nix.
Both Guix and Nix are very different from traditional Linux distributions. They are both based around expression languages that enable the OS to be configured as code. For example, if I want to install and configure <a href="https://xmonad.org">Xmonad</a> I could use the following or at it to my configuration. (This is code for another tool, <a href="https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.html">home-manager</a>, but the idea is the same)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-nix" data-lang="nix">{

 };
 };
}
</code></pre></div><p>This type of configuration allows for a workflow similar to Ansible, Puppet, or Chef. The difference is that the package manager and the operating system are aware of the state. Role backs, for instance, are supported, even at the boot menu level. If you change your configuration and break the start-up process, you can simply boot into the previous configuration and fix it. This feature is built-in functionality that the OS is aware of, not something bolted on like many of the ZFS/package manager solutions that are popular now.
Nix is also not dependent on the traditional file system structure for binaries that most Linux distributions use. While you typically find Python at <code>/usr/bin/python</code> or something similar, Nix uses a hash such as <code>/nix/store/hb1lzaisgx2m9n29hqhh6yp6hasplq1v-python3-3.9.10/bin/python</code>. This hashed path enables several cool features, but the first is that you can use more than one version of Python or any other tool.
Nix-shell also allows you to have dependencies that are not in your <code>$PATH</code> for specific projects or folders. So you can <code>cd</code> into a directory where all of your dev tools will show up, but they will not be there while you are doing random things on your computer. It can also be helpful if you just need to run a program once but don&rsquo;t want to keep it installed as it can be cleaned up automatically later without you having to do anything.</p>
